# Paxe
## Processing + Haxe

I loved how processing was easy and simple to use and taught me a lot. I also loved that Haxe allows people to create apps for a lot of platforms and targets. Unfortunately Haxe isn't very popular and Processing doesn't have as much platforms so I decided to combine the two into my own library. Hopefully this may help people learn Haxe and allow Processing users the ability to see there projects on more devices. Paxe is still very unstable and I might even rewrite the entire thing again, but hopefully in the end it would be easier for anyone to create generative design on Windows, Mac OSX, Linux, iOS, Android, HTML5, Raspberry Pi, or even Flash. Heck it may even be possible to try it on a Playstation or an XBox in the future [link](https://haxe.org/videos/conferences/haxe-summit-us-2018/console-punks-haxe-for-xbox-playstation-dan-goldstein.html)).
